## Plot made by Plotly

``` {r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F, results = "hide"}
library(quantmod)
library(plotly)

from.dat <- Sys.Date() - 30
to.dat <- Sys.Date()

getSymbols(c("^GSPC"), src = "yahoo", from = from.dat, to = to.dat)
gspcClose <- Cl(GSPC)
SP500 <- data.frame(gspcClose) %>% mutate(Time = time(gspcClose))
```

``` {r, echo = F}
plot_ly(data = SP500, x = ~Time, y= ~GSPC.Close, 
        type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
        layout(title = "SP500 Index for the last 30 days")
```
